# Technical Roadmap

Here you can find the technical roadmap for the joint and distributed development of the DINA modules.
The issues represent high-level stages and related timelines for the progress of the development e.g. design, implementation and testing of releases per module.

More detailed tasks (e.g. code review) and issues related to modules will be accommodated in dedicated repos for each module.
